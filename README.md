# initialize

`initialize` is a web development boilerplate with automation to help you bootstrap your project.

# Prerequisite

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for NPM
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for SASS/SCSS
- [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [GIT/GIT Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

initialize is using preprocessor (SCSS) by default, but you can always modify the `app.css` file in `app/assets/css` directory.
But it is highly recommended to use [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/install).

# Installation
1. Clone the project using GIT or download the zip file then cd to the directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm run initialize:dep`. This will install bower and npm dependencies.
3. Run `npm run initialize` to start initialize!
4. CREATE AWESOME STUFF!

# Commands

1. initialize      - start initialize
2. initialize:dep  - install npm and bower dependencies
3. initialize:lib  - compile/minify libraries into a single minified file
4. initialize:img  - optimize images
5. initialize:help - help menu
6. initialize:?    - help menu

# Listen!
This toolkit is currently under development and it's on its alpha state, but I'm doing my best to integrate more functionalities that can make this toolkit usable in any web development situation.

I'm open for suggestions!
