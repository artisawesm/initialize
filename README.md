A Front End Web Development tool that automates minification and bundling of assets, provides Search Engine Optimized boilerplate and promotes modular coding with the help of the latest JS Frameworks.

# What do we have here

**`Initializr`** is powered by [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), I also integrated [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) on its core and planning to add the flexibility to use [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) as well, **`Initializr`** is also using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as the ES6 transpiler and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the main Front End framework.

# Setting up

1. Install [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [Gulp Js](https://gulpjs.com/) **Required**
2. Open your terminal and clone [**`Initializr`**](https://github.com/artisawesm/initializr) **OR** install it using `npm install initializr`.
3. Install all the dependencies using `npm run ini:setup`.
4. Then run **`Initializr`** by typing `npm run ini` on your terminal.
5. Your default browser will open with the **`Initializr`** running.

Congratulations, you're now using the awesome **`Initializr`**!.

# How `initializr` works

Simply type `npm run` followed by the command. i.e. `npm run ini`.

1. **ini:setup** : install dependencies.
2. **ini** : start **`initializr`** in `development` mode.
3. **ini:prod** : bundles and minifies `JS` and `CSS` files for `production`.

**PHPloy Commands for `initializr`**

**`initializr`** also supports [PHPloy](https://github.com/banago/PHPloy) for deployment. PHPloy can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

1. **ini:phploy** : this will setup PHPloy on your directory by adding `phploy.ini` file.
2. **ini:deploy** : this will deploy your changes on the server.

# Thank you!

This project was once the solution for my tardiness and procrastinations, I guess I should start working on this full time, tomorrow.
