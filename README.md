# initialize
`initialize` (temporary name) is a web development toolkit that provides boilerplate and also automates your workflow to help you bootstrap your projects.

# Prerequisite
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [GIT/GIT Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Note
initialize is using preprocessor (SCSS) by default, but you can always modify the `app.css` file in `app/assets/css` directory, however it is highly recommended to use [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/install).

# Installation (4 easy steps)
1. Open your terminal and clone the project then `cd` to the directory.
2. Install all the necessary dependencies using `npm run initialize:install`.
3. To start initialize simply type `npm run initialize` on your terminal.
4. Be AWESOME!

# Commands
To use the commands simply type `npm run` followed by the command. i.e. `npm run initialize:help`
1. initialize           : start initialize
2. initialize:install   : install dependencies
3. initialize:compile   : compile and minify libraries into a single `lib.min.js` and `lib.min.css` file
4. initialize:optimize  : optimize images `PNG, JPG, SVG`
5. initialize:help      : display commands
6. initialize:?         : display commands
